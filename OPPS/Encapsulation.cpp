/* 
ðŸ“Œ Encapsulation --->

Definition:
    Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to the data.
    It is achieved by making fields private and providing getter and setter methods to access or modify them.

âœ… Importance / Benefits of Encapsulation

1. Data Hiding:
    Protects the internal state of the object from unauthorized access.
    Prevents accidental modification of important data.

2. Controlled Access:
    You can control what values are set using validation inside setters.

3. Improved Security:
    Sensitive information stays safe from direct access.

4. Maintainability:
    Internal implementation can be changed without affecting external code.

5. Flexibility:
    You can make certain fields read-only or write-only.

6. Reusability:
    Well-encapsulated code is modular and easier to reuse.
